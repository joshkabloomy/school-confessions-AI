Ive been in love with this girl for a while now, but I don't know how to get over her. She's a very nice person and I like her a lot but I don't want to be her boyfriend. We don't really talk anymore :(
====================
I just saw a post from someone who seems to be struggling with weight loss and are starting to struggle with self esteem. I'm not saying that they need to "accept it" or "look for the light", I just mean that they see it as a burden. I don't mean that they've "accepted" the fact that they're not as skinny as other people who are naturally fit. I'm not saying that they don't need to look at the light. I'm just saying that if someone told me they are not as fit as other people, it would be extremely hurtful. I'm honestly soooo proud of myself for being able to talk to someone who is so clearly struggling with this and also be proud of myself for telling them. Thank you for the kind words :)

Wakanda sakshi is honestly so hot. I can only watch her on Disney channel 3 times per week.

I don't get why people get pissed over the smallest things. Like the sound effect, or even the amount of pressure they felt when someone played a certain tune. I get that they felt uncomfortable but if you're just tuning it out then why can't you have any other small decisions you made. I get that they felt unsafe but why would you want to. They feel uncomfortable (in my opinion anyway) with the smallest decisions you can make. I'm not gonna pick on you espers cuz I donít really know the context of most of them. But there's still a long way to go and I hope to god you learn to value your neighborliness. I think the DNI got tired of complaining about being in a bad neighborhood and complaining all the time. We are living in a country where complaints are not worth complaints. 
====================
I found out someone really close to me and wanted to ask her out, but she rejected me. She told me that she had to cheat on me and to stop telling me her life. She's a cheater. I also asked her out, but she rejected me. She's a liar.

the first time i masturbated was in 8th grade. like yeah, i kinda did that ngl. i tried on clothes from the days before and it didn't really work. like i was like abstaining for like a week then doing the traditional prostate rub. like the week before I was like omg. it's not even that bad. it's just that weird. the week before, i had a lot of work and now i do a lot of work too, like every other day. also masturbation isnt the end of the world. i used to masturbate a lot in the beginning of highschool. like i was in 7th grade. now, i have like 10 extracurriculars and stuff, and i don't even use the boys bathrooms so i dont get the constant piss-peeing. also, i'm a religious person and i dont really masturbate. my dad likes to read the Holy Bible and read the Holy Spirit. and i dont even talk to my mom. I literally have no freedom in my own life. I choose not to do any of this because my parents is scared of me losing my virginity, and if i do, their expectations are extremely high. They expect me to follow
====================
I miss my ex.

He used to love me and talk to me a lot and be my friend and everything and now he doesn't even ask or show me anything and acts like he knows everything. I miss him and everything and honestly I'm just so tired of everything.

I'm gonna miss him and everything and I wish I could just stop talking to him. I wish I could have a reason to. I wish I could talk to him more. I wish I could go outside of my friend group and talk to him. I wish I could go out with him and have more of a friend-he's such a good person, I wish I could go out with him and be with him every night and not have any issues.

I hate everything. I hate my life. I hate everything I've had to go through. I wish I had a reason to hate myself. I wish I could just stop talking to him. I wish I was as happy as I always were and wouldn't have to make a move."

Why TF are all the senior class officers dating each other and have prom dates and be in love with each other the very next day. All of us have reason to be worried that the other freshman officers are cheating on the freshman class. I am a senior and I am overqualified to be the class officer. This is not how this works.
====================
I feel like everyone in my family is gay. My mom is a feminist, my dad a racist, and I think my mom is straight. I donít know if Iím bi, but whenever I try to talk to my friends about it, they say that itís a ìfantasyî my mom has.

Does anyone have tips for laying on the ground? I laid on my back in a pile yesterday, trying to relieve myself. I heard some guy moaning about how I should have my back turned, but it's so lame now....

Brucker is the sweetest teacher ever

I feel like people don't realize how much is going on in the msj debate. The person who introduced jr since he's freshman says he has so many friends and he's just crushing on everyone. Iím not looking at you Chan Loh, why so desperate ?? You can tell my friends jr has friends too. 
====================
I hate that I am the only person in my fam using the derogatory term "lazy hoe." Like, yeah, I am. But...
====================
I like this one girl, but like everyone thinks she's just as fake as me. Like I have more confidence issues, more anxiety, and I'm not sure how I can deal with them. My friends make fun of her when she's not in a hurry or walks around worrying she's wayyy too nice. Like, stop being so mean. Ik why the fuck are you making so many jokes about me like I'm just a joke. Ik you're literally trying to hurt me. 
====================
Brucker is so good. It's so easy to forget that everyone is a piece of shit in this world.
====================
I am very happy to announce that I, and a majority of the school, will be accepting of all Ph.D. candidates applying to CS at MSJ. This will be my first year teaching and I am extremely grateful and excited to be part of something so amazing. 
====================
I just can't stop eating super oily, oily, fast foods. I get so much sugar in them, and their oil just sits there. I just can't stop. I have cramps all day long. I swear to god I cleaned them out before every meal. I grinded the food up thick and stick of sometimes. I cannot stop myself.
====================
I hate Mission
====================
I am a senior and I have a c in Peralta's class. I don't want to have to go to summer school. There is a Peralta student in the room today who is a little annoying. He makes a class diagram with one of my two c's and makes me 20 bucks a day. I hate this class so much. 
====================
How do you slide into a hole?
====================
I like a girl and she likes me back but I'm not his type :(
====================
I am feeling so depressed right now. I have a b+ in apchem and I'm so stressed out. My family is so supportive but they literally don't appreciate my grades. I am constantly checking to see whether my teacher is open for questions and I always see a tiny dot on the screen and a pop up asking if I can ask a question. I hate that feeling. I can't focus all my efforts on this and I'm so frustrated. 
====================
*cough NNN* 

I have a crush on a cute sophomore boy in a class that is full of juniors and seniors. I am not sure if he is actually me or if he is just me. I don't want to mess up our relationship cause he already knows I'm texting him. 
====================
For Brucker/Hopkins/Larsen/Szabo/Dani all the rest have fake lips...
